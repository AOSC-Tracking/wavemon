.SH NAME
$HOME/.wavemonrc \- wavemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIwavemonrc\fR is the per-user configuration file for \fBwavemon\fR(1).
This page describes its individual configuration options.  Each corresponds
to a configuration item of the \fIPreferences\fR screen (F7 key), whose
on-screen name is shown in parentheses.
.P
.B interface = <ifname>
.RS
.RE
(Interface)
.RS
Selects the wireless interface to use.
.P
.RE
.B cisco_mac = (on|off)
.RS
.RE
(Cisco-style MAC addresses)
.RS
If enabled, display MAC addresses using lower-case hex digits separated by dots
rather than colons.
.P
.RE
.B scan_filter_band = (2.4ghz|5ghz|both)
.RS
.RE
(Scan band selection)
.RS
Filter bands in the scan window: \fI2.4ghz\fR (2.4GHz only), \fI5ghz\fR (5GHz only), or \fIboth\fR (show both bands).
.P
.RE
.B scan_hidden_essids = (on|off)
.RS
.RE
(Scan hidden ESSIDs)
.RS
Whether the scan window should include hidden ESSIDs.
.P
.RE
.B sort_order = (channel|essid|mac|signal|open|chan/sig|open/sig)
.RS
.RE
(Scan sort type)
.RS
Determines the ordering used in the scan window: \fIchannel\fR sorts by channel number, \fIessid\fR by
access point name, \fImac\fR by MAC address, \fIsignal\fR by signal strength, and \fIopen\fR by openness.
The combined variants \fIchan/sig\fR and \fIopen/sig\fR sort first by channel/openness and then by signal strength.
It also affects the status line at the bottom: normally the most crowded channels are listed,
sorting by \fIchannel\fR in descending order switches to least crowded ones instead.
.P
.RE
.B sort_ascending = (on|off)
.RS
.RE
(Scan sort direction)
.RS
Sets the direction of the \fIsort_order\fR: ascending (on) or descending (off).
.P
.P
.RE
.B stat_updates = <n>
.RS
.RE
(Statistics updates)
.RS
Time interval for polling new statistics (including scan refresh). Range: 10..4000ms.
.P
.RE
.B lhist_slot_size = <n>
.RS
.RE
(Histogram update cycles)
.RS
Number of samples used per each histogram slot. For example, if the stat_updates
interval is 500ms and the histogram slot size is 4, the histogram is moved
one slot further every 2 seconds. Range: 1..64.
.P
.RE
.B meter_smoothness = <n>
.RS
.RE
(Level meter smoothness)
.RS
Determines the responsiveness of level meters, tracking the moving average
rather than following each new sample. The given value specifies the percentage
of the history (the 'inertia') of preceding samples. A value of 0 disables
this option. Range: 0..99%.
.P
.RE
.B info_updates = <n>
.RS
.RE
(Dynamic info updates)
.RS
Sets refresh rate for dynamic device parameters (e.g. bitrate) and the
refresh interval for the Scan window (F3). Range: 1..60s.
.P
.RE
.B override_auto_scale = (on|off)
.RS
.RE
(Override scale autodetect)
.RS
Override the auto-scaling of the bar graphs and histogram, allowing you to set your own scales.
.P
.RE
.B min_signal_level, max_signal_level = <n>
.RS
.RE
(Minimum signal level, Maximum signal level)
.RS
Set the left and right boundaries of the signal level scales. Ranges: \-100..\-39 (minimum) and \-40..\-10dBm (maximum).
.P
.RE
.B transparent_bg = (on|off)
.RS
.RE
(Use a transparent background)
.RS
Use a transparent background instead of black. This is enabled by default and can only be turned off via the startup file.
.P
.RE
.B startup_screen = (info|histogram|scan window)
.RS
.RE
(Startup screen)
.RS
Which of the screens appears at program startup.
